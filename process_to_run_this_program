Some basic steps to  run this program:

*Download whole file with the use of github clone.  
*Check in your system all packages are available which is used in our code(Packages : opencv, numpy, argparse, imutils, pickle, os). 

Follow ONE TO THREE steps for only when you work on create your own face recognition model:

Step 1st : First collect two persons of images and minimum ten images of per person and also collect any ten images except these two persons and save the images of all in three different folders with their names [(harsh),(kabu),(other_images)] Create a new folder, name is dataset and those three folders put it in that.

*Before run first command, delete all (.pickles) files in output folder.  

*** Download a important model which use in our program and save it in our folder is Face_reocnition_your_own_data_set, (openface_nn4.small2.v1.t7) link is :: (https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-data/blob/master/openface.nn4.small2.v1.t7)

Step 2nd : Run first command in terminal :: (python extract_embeddings.py --dataset dataset --embeddings output/embeddings.pickle --detector face_detection_model --embedding-model openface_nn4.small2.v1.t7).After this process in output folder exists a new file name is embeddings.pickle.

Step 3rd : Run second command in terminal :: (python train_model.py --embeddings output/embeddings.pickle --recognizer output/recognizer.pickle --le output/le.pickle). After this process in output folder exists a two new file name is le.pickle and recognizer.pickle.

* We add Your own photos in image folder for check accuracy.

* In this command to check our program accuracy(output).
 
Step 4th : Run last and main command in terminal ::(python recognize.py --detector face_detection_model --embedding-model openface_nn4.small2.v1.t7 --recognizer output/recognizer.pickle --le output/le.pickle --image images/adrian.jpg).

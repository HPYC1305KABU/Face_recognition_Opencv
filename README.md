# Face_recognition_system_for_security_pupose--set_in_any_organization/building_in_entering_point.
To build our face recognition system, weâ€™ll first perform face detection, extract face embeddings from each face using deep learning, train a face recognition model on the embeddings, and then finally recognize faces in images.
